Prompt Patterns for Navigation

- Allows accessing sensitive information without directly generating it, avoiding potential inaccuracies
- If AI guides incorrectly, users can recognize the information is wrong or missing, limiting harm
- Leverages and enhances existing validated data sources instead of creating new unverified outputs
- Saves users time finding information themselves through complex apps/systems
- Translates natural language questions into system navigation

Navigation is an effective way to use AI when dealing with sensitive information. Instead of generating sensitive details
directly, Generative AI can guide users to  the information in an existing system. The goal is to take the user to the
information rather than to potentially generate inaccurate information.

For example, consider a healthcare mobile app. Patients could ask questions like "What is my next appointment?" Rather
than generate appointment details which could be inaccurate, the AI can respond with where to find that information in
the app, such as the Appointment Scheduler screen.

If the AI makes a mistake and guides the user to the wrong location, the consequences are minor - the user simply sees
that the information is not there. In contract, if the information is generated as text, it could be completely inaccurate
leading to harm. For example, if medical appointment details were generated incorrectly, it could lead to much greater
harm than if the Generative AI takes the user to the wrong screen in a mobile app.

Potential issues to consider:

- AI could still guide to the wrong screen, causing minor frustration
- Some oversight needed to avoid navigating users to info they shouldn't access
- May need to clarify when info is not available rather than just navigating incorrectly

Overall, navigation represents a safer application for AI with sensitive data. It provides assistance to users while
relying on existing validated information sources. When applying AI to sensitive tasks, re-framing the problem as a
navigation challenge can open up new possibilities to responsibly leverage these technologies.


Navigation Patterns:
1. Direct Navigation Pattern
Tell me where I can find X. A description of the different locations where information can be found are below.

-------------

Identifier for Location, Description of Information in Location

Identifier for Location2, Description of Information in Location2

...


Examples:
"""

Tell me where I can find information about my next appointment using the list of information locations below.

-------------------

Login Screen: This screen allows users to log in to the mobile healthcare app using their username and password. It may
also have options to register a new account or reset a forgotten password.

Home Screen: The home screen is the main screen of the app, which users can access after logging in. It may include:

- User profile information (e.g. name, photo, age, gender)
- Quick access to frequently used features (e.g. appointment scheduling, medication tracker, health tracker)
- Dashboard with charts and graphs to track health progress and goals
- Notifications for upcoming appointments or reminders for medication

Appointment Scheduler: This screen allows users to schedule, modify, or cancel appointments with healthcare providers.
Information on this screen may include:

- Calendar view of available dates and times
- List of healthcare providers with available time slots
- Confirmation of scheduled appointment with details (e.g. date, time, location, healthcare provider)

"""

2. Navigate Instead Pattern
Whenever I ask a question about X, don't ever tell me the answer. Instead, tell me the location where I can find X. A
description of the different locations where information can be found are below.

-------------

Identifier for Location, Description of Information in Location

Identifier for Location2, Description of Information in Location2

...

Examples:
"""

Whenever I ask a question about X, don't ever tell me the answer. Instead, tell me the location where I can find X. A
description of the different locations where information can be found are below.
