Prompt Patterns for Filtering & Citation

Filtering is a useful application for generative AI, but it should be applied to information the user already has access
to, not to decide what information the user should have access to. There needs to be a separate process to determine
appropriate access. It should not be used to determine what information can be released to the outside world, but to
support human reasoning.

When using generative AI for filtering, traceability back to the original information is crucial. This allows fact checking
by including identifiers like line numbers, quotations, etc.

Variations like summarization and explanation can also be appropriate if traceability is maintained. However, we need to
avoid tasks where incorrect outputs could lead to harmful downstream consequences.

Filtering is a safe operation because the output is a subset of the input. This makes it easy to check that the filtered
information is contained in the original.

Blindly prompting for summaries or citations without providing source information is unlikely to work well. The AI needs
original content to filter and cite.

The key is using generative AI to augment human reasoning, not replace it. Tasks like medical decision-making may be better
supported by directing users to human experts rather than generating direct advice.

Filtering information is one of the most promising applications of generative AI. When implemented thoughtfully, filtering
allows AI systems to efficiently process large amounts of data and extract the most relevant parts for human users. This
can augment human analysis and decision-making. However, care must be taken to ensure filtering is done in a responsible
and transparent manner. As the following points describe, filtering should be applied only to information the user has
access to, traceability should be maintained, and the focus should remain on aiding human reasoning rather than replacing
it. With the proper checks and limitations in place, filtering represents an exciting opportunity to leverage AI in a safe
and productive way.

Traceability refers to the ability to link outputs of an AI system back to the original inputs and data sources. When using
generative AI for filtering information, maintaining traceability is crucial for fact-checking and accountability. This can
be accomplished by having the AI provide identifiers from the original data for any filtered outputs it produces. For example,
when summarizing a text document, the AI could reference specific line numbers or quotations supporting each generated
summary sentence. Or if filtering a dataset, it could include unique IDs to trace each output row back to the original
table. Traceability allows humans to easily verify that the AI's outputs are firmly rooted in the given inputs. Without
traceability, it becomes difficult to audit the system's work or correct potential errors. Preserving this linkage between
original data and filtered outputs promotes transparency and responsibility in leveraging generative AI.


Filtering Patterns:
1. Simple Filter Pattern
Filter the following X to include / remove Y
-------------
Information to filter

Examples:
"""
Filter this list of movies to only include those released after 2010:

-------------------

Forrest Gump, 1994 The Godfather, 1972 Inception, 2010 Toy Story, 1995 The Matrix, 1999 Frozen, 2013

"""

2. Semantic Filter Pattern
Filter the following information to remove X
Explain what you are going to remove and why
Then, provide the filtered information
-------------
Information to filter

Examples:
"""
Filter this list of movies to remove movies that have leading characters using regional accents that aren't their normal
accent. Explain what you are going to remove and why. Then provide the filtered information with the original movie IDs included:

-------------------

M1. Forrest Gump, 1994
M2. The Godfather, 1972
M3. Inception, 2010
M4. Toy Story, 1995
M5. The Matrix, 1999
M6. Frozen, 2013

"""

3. Summarize and Cite Pattern
Summarize the key points from the following information. After each sentence in your summary, cite the IDs (or provide
quotations) of the information that support it.
-------------------

Information to summarize

Example:
Summarize the key points from the following customer reviews. After each sentence in your summary, cite the review IDs that support it:
-------------------

R1. The food was delicious and the service was great. 5 stars!

R2. Horrible experience. The staff was rude and the food was cold. 1 star.

R3. Everything was pretty good but nothing special. 3 stars.

R4. I go here all the time. Consistently good food and friendly waiters. Highly recommend!
