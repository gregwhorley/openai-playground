- One common inappropriate use of LLMs is to think of them as a source of facts
- Do not treat LLM like an online search tool i.e. google
- LLMs are an engine that can help you to do all kinds of interesting things in computing and to do all kinds of interesting
    natural language analyses and that you can build really powerful capabilities on top of. But it itself is not necessarily
    going to give you correct facts.
- Possible use case is to enhance an internet search to retrieve relevant results
- Another use case is to help the user navigate through an app to get the desired info
- Checking answers for accuracy is important, but how easily they can be checked will vary
- Example of easily checking answers is using LLM to generate answer to Wordle problem
  - given the partial word and empty spaces, list of prohibited letters, and limiting answer to a known word in the English language
  - when generating an answer, it can easily be validated by observing the criteria given to the LLM
  - in example case, the answer given by LLM contained a letter in the list of prohibited letters
- Consider the cost of checking for the accuracy of an answer generated by LLM; if the cost to benefit ratio is too high, then
    it is not worth the effort
- Another possible use case is to generate answers for questions in order to overcome roadblocks where it does not matter
    whether the answer is correct or not, but that it gets the user to think differently about the problem they're facing
- Consider the risk behind prompting for answers that may incur damage to health, finances, or worse
  - Example of risky prompt, "Is it safe for me to take Tylenol?"
